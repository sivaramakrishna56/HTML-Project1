        <div class="head"><b>SOLAR SYSTEM</b></div>
        <div class="body">
            <div class="x">The Solar System is a dynamic system with the Sun at its center, surrounded by planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial objects. Here's a detailed breakdown:</div>

            <div class="i">1. The Sun</div>
            <div class="x">The Sun is a medium-sized star at the heart of the Solar System, providing light and heat through nuclear fusion. It is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, and its immense gravitational force governs the orbits of all objects within the system. The Sun's energy supports life on Earth and drives the climate and weather.</div>

            <div class="ii">2. Planets of the Solar System</div>
            <div class="x">The eight planets are divided into two main categories: terrestrial (rocky) planets and gas giants.</div>

            <div class="A">A. Terrestrial Planets (Inner Planets)</div>
            <div class="x">These planets are closer to the Sun and have solid, rocky surfaces.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Mercury:</strong> The smallest and closest planet to the Sun. It has a barren, cratered surface and experiences extreme temperature variations.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Venus:</strong> Similar in size to Earth but with a thick, toxic atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Its surface is extremely hot due to a runaway greenhouse effect.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Earth:</strong> The only known planet to support life, Earth has liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, and a protective magnetic field. It also has one large moon.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Mars:</strong> Known as the "Red Planet" because of its iron oxide-rich surface. Mars has polar ice caps, the largest volcano in the Solar System, and evidence suggests it once had liquid water.</div>

            <div class="B">B. Gas Giants (Outer Planets)</div>
            <div class="x">These planets are much larger than the terrestrial planets and are composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and other gases.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Jupiter:</strong> The largest planet, known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm system. It has a thick atmosphere and dozens of moons, including the volcanic Io and ice-covered Europa.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Saturn:</strong> Famous for its extensive ring system, Saturn is also a gas giant with a mostly hydrogen and helium atmosphere. It has numerous moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere.</div>

            <div class="C">C. Ice Giants</div>
            <div class="x"><strong>Uranus:</strong> An ice giant with a blue-green hue due to methane in its atmosphere. It rotates on its side, possibly due to a past collision, and has faint rings.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Neptune:</strong> The farthest planet from the Sun, it is a dark, cold ice giant with strong winds and a deep blue color. Neptune has several moons, the largest being Triton.</div>

            <div class="iii">3. Dwarf Planets</div>
            <div class="x">In addition to the eight primary planets, there are several dwarf planets.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Pluto:</strong> Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet. It has a thin atmosphere and a large moon, Charon.</div>
            <div class="x">Other dwarf planets include Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, all located in the distant Kuiper Belt.</div>
            <div class="iv">4. Moons</div>
            <div class="x">Many planets have moons, which vary in size and composition. Earthâ€™s moon is large relative to the planet, while some planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, have dozens of moons. Some moons, such as Europa (Jupiter) and Enceladus (Saturn), are of particular interest because they may harbor subsurface oceans.</div>

            <div class="v">5. Asteroids</div>
            <div class="x">Asteroids are rocky objects, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They range in size from tiny pebbles to large bodies hundreds of kilometers wide. Some asteroids are remnants from the early Solar System and may contain valuable metals and minerals.</div>

            <div class="vi">6. Comets</div>
            <div class="x">Comets are icy bodies that originate from the outer regions of the Solar System, particularly the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. When they approach the Sun, their ice vaporizes, creating bright tails that can stretch for millions of kilometers. Comets are often considered frozen time capsules of the early Solar System.</div>

            <div class="vii">7. The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud</div>
            <div class="x"><strong>Kuiper Belt:</strong> A region beyond Neptune that contains many icy bodies, including dwarf planets and comets. It is similar to the asteroid belt but much larger and more distant.</div>

            <div class="x"><strong>Oort Cloud:</strong> A distant, spherical cloud of icy objects believed to surround the Solar System at a great distance. It is thought to be the source of long-period comets.</div>

            <div class="viii">8. Gravitational Influence and Orbital Dynamics</div>
            <div class="x">The planets and other objects in the Solar System orbit the Sun due to its strong gravitational pull. The orbits are mostly elliptical, though some are more eccentric than others. The outer planets take much longer to orbit the Sun compared to the inner planets, with Neptune completing one orbit in over 160 Earth years.</div>

            <div class="x">The Solar System is a vast and varied place, with each planet, moon, and small body playing a unique role in the overall structure of this cosmic neighborhood.</div>
