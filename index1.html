    <p>&emsp;The solar system is a vast and complex structure centered around the Sun, a medium-sized star located in the Milky Way galaxy. It comprises eight major planets, their moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. The planets are divided into two groups: the rocky inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—and the gas giants in the outer solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The Sun's gravitational pull keeps these planets in orbit, providing the necessary energy for life on Earth. Each planet follows a unique elliptical orbit and varies greatly in size, composition, and atmospheric conditions. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, contains numerous rocky fragments, while the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, beyond Neptune, are home to icy bodies and comets.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust. Over time, it evolved into the structured system we observe today. It remains a subject of intense scientific study, offering insights into planetary formation, the potential for extraterrestrial life, and the dynamics of celestial mechanics.</p>
